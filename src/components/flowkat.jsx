          <h2>B2C booking platform</h2>
          <h3>Anyhau Oy</h3>
          <span>
            Role: Design lead, product owner, "scrum master", product manager
          </span>
          <p>
            <h4>Background</h4>
            Anyhau was a startup building a new marketplace that unites pet
            owners and pet businesses. At the moment there is no
            well-functioning booking platform that caters specifically to pet
            businesses’ unique needs in comparison to, for example, beauty
            salons. All the while all pet businesses handle bookings in their
            own methods ranging from Google Calendar to whiteboards.
            <h4>Solution</h4>I ran daily routines (dailies, weeklies, demos,
            refinements, feedbacks etc.), seeing over the development work of
            the product, and kept all stakeholders up to date on the progress.
            Meanwhile, I designed the platform's MVP, multiple visual assets as
            well as coded some of the frontend (such as a Material theme for the
            component library). During the process I kept in close contact with
            both business and consumer users to listen to their needs. During
            the time, we also tried Shape Up-method as an agile method with
            great learnings.

          <h2>The Election Machines</h2>
          <h3>Sanoma Media Finland</h3>
          <span>Role: Lead Designer</span>
          <p>
            <h4>Background</h4>
            My main responsibility during my time at HS was to lead the design
            of the renewal of the election machines (vaalikone in Finnish), that
            is used by Helsingin Sanomat, Ilta-Sanomat and Aamulehti as well as
            regional brands. The new election machines needed to serve time
            well: use a consistent, well guided UX that is mainly used by
            younger audiences on mobile devices on the app or browser. Use cases
            would vary: from the urgent need for a candidate on the way to a
            voting site to browsing heavily months prior to elections.
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            From early on, the focus was on creating a platform that could last
            time well so we developed an in-house solution that had hints of
            gamification; tiny rewards for users to make filling the form as
            easy as possible. The election machine consisted of three user
            interfaces: the candidate machine, election machine to the voters
            and results service for election night. Design-wise the style was
            taken to monochromatic direction using as high contrasts as
            possible, giving homage to Nintendo-style gaming experience where
            user has a set of controls and where progress feels more like a
            game, rather than a set of questions. The main focus was on
            customization: making the use of election machine as fast as
            possible when time is of the essence to being able to dig in as deep
            as possible and answering as many questions as user wants.

          <h2>Sokos ecommerce platform</h2>
          <h3>SOK Design</h3>
          <span>Role: UX Designer</span>
          <p>
            <h4>Background</h4>
            During my post as a designer for Sokos, I was in charge of designing
            the whole UI for a new ecommerce platform. This meant building a
            component library and whole UI design from the ground up; defining
            and creating the color models, typography rules, baseline grid,
            layout guidelines, variants and statuses as well as UX models. The
            old platform had met the end of its life cycle and thus, a new
            platform was custom-made.
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            After building a visual identity for the new platform, countless
            Figma prototypes later, the goal was to create a beta store. In the
            development of the beta store I positioned myself in several roles.
            In close cooperation with the front and back-end devs we started to
            add more layers onto the foundation built before. Using a design
            system, for which I had built a theme using Typescript, we aimed to
            scale the development and design to a more aligned model. From user
            tests we concluded UX improvements that were done as part of
            development. Alongside the ecommerce platform, one project that is
            worth mentioning is the development of SOK Design System. A
            rewarding experience in it was kickstarting work regarding a
            consistent iconography with designers from several parts of the
            organisation.

          <h2>Website redesign & development</h2>
          <h3>Solidabis</h3>
          <span>Role: Designer/Developer</span>
          <p>
            <h4>Background</h4>
            The Wordpress-based website of Solidabis Solutions Oy had been
            deprecated style-wise and technically, using a theme that did not
            serve the users (editors) and viewers (potential customers, existing
            customers) well. Bulky and heavy font selections, unreadable texts,
            alignment issues and heavy load times were dragging the user
            experience. Moreover, a few vulnerabilities in the the theme had
            caused an issue for potential blacklisting of IP:s for frequent
            visitors.
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            As a solution, I redesigned the website entirely, using a Wordpress
            framework (Genesis) for which I developed a child theme, to align
            with the new styles and to give a brighter, more current look for
            the website. I redeveloped the website using PHP with basic HTML5
            and CSS/SASS to stylize the website. After that, I designed and
            created new content for the website, including some iconography,
            plenty of copywriting and photography.

          <h2>Accessibility audit</h2>

          <span>Role: Accessibility expert (pro bono)</span>
          <p>
            <h4>Background</h4>
            Ruskeat Tytöt Media was updating their website and I offered to help
            them out pro bono to respond to accessibility issues and identify
            possible solutions to existing problems. Ruskeat Tytöt Media is an
            independent online publication committed to centering and
            normalizing the perspectives of Brown women and people with
            underrepresented genders in Finnish and Nordic media. Ruskeat Tytöt
            Media is Finland’s first culture media [and writing academy] for
            Brown Girls by Brown Girls.
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            Using the WCAG 2.1 guidelines, I audited the website during and
            after development, during which I drafted guidelines for how to
            solve problems with accessibility. As a deliverable, I also provided
            an accessibility report, found on their website.

          <span>Role: UI Designer & Developer</span>
          <p>
            <h4>Background</h4>
            The Finnish Patent and Registration Office (PRH) needed a website
            that would go online in the case of a service outage, maintenance
            break or any other unexpected event. The website would need to have
            three pages in Finnish, English and Swedish: front page, a list of
            unaffected services and contact information page, editable in
            Dreamweaver. The goal is to portray a message, that the service
            outage is temporary and will be fixed as soon as possible.
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            Using custom Bootstrap styling from the other project I had
            developed for PRH, I designed the page entity that responded to the
            aforementioned challenges. The page entity was a Bootstrap 4-powered
            website that would be customizable by the PRH communications
            department. I designed the elements and outlined the page which then
            complemented the style guide as an example page as well.

            Edunsaaja-apuri can be used to determine if an entity is entitled to
            benefits or required for providing extra information. After an
            accessibility audit, some fixes needed to be done to make the
            website accessible and WCAG 2.1 compliant.
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            Using WCAG guidelines and the audit, I fixed the accessibility
            errors and problems with the website which was done with JavaScript
            and HTML5&CSS. Most of the work was only code.

          <p>
            <h4>Background</h4>
            The Auditor Oversight business unit of PRH had tendered out the
            redevelopment of their digital services to Gofore, a Finnish digital
            consultancy. However, the bid didn’t include any designers but only
            process and software developers. As the only designer present in the
            redevelopment processes, I took it upon myself to ensure that the
            solutions were usable, accessible and responded to business demands.
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            The Auditor search service was done in React with Bootstrap and
            custom styling I had started to redevelop on another project. It
            reflected on a developing style guide and provided ideas for
            improvement for the design system as well.

          <span>Role: Designer</span>
          <p>
            <h4>Background</h4>
            The Finnish Patent and Registration Office (PRH) didn’t have an
            official document model that was used on digitally-generated
            documents. The documents followed a simple automatically generated
            format, meaning that they were unaccessible, unrecognizable and
            subject to fraud. The documents would have to reflect PRH and their
            documents’ official nature throughout their services from receipts
            to registrations and patents.
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            Together with another designer we designed a variety of document
            templates that we tested in workshops internally in each business
            unit that would be using the model. After, we modified the documents
            to respond to workshop feedback, made the documents accessible to
            screen readers and clarified the font usage and header levels, which
            were then delivered to the technical team as templates and
            instructions.

            <h4>Background</h4>
            The Finnish Patent and Registration Office (PRH) partnered with us
            to maintain, redevelop and redesign their custom Bootstrap-styling.
            PRH didn’t own a systematic way of presenting the styles nor
            instructing contractors and in-house developers how to use the
            styles, especially with accessibility in mind. The custom
            Bootstrap-styles had previously been developed by several
            contractors, based on Bootstrap 3 and used widely on a variety of
            digital services.
            <h4>Solution</h4>I suggested building a component library for
            developers and other stakeholders to use in their daily work on an
            open-source platform (Storybook). As part of the development, I
            redesiged the styling, fixed accessibility issues, created code
            snippets and documented each component individually and maintained
            the whole component library into an npm package. I developed the
            styleguide on JavaScript and matched it with a Sketch-library from
            scratch to support designers; a starting point of a design system
            for PRH.

            <h4>Background</h4>
            Solidabis is a growing software development company that has had a
            variety of structural and cultural changes in its history since the
            founding in 2016. The changes have led to the company not having
            clear and concise image to potential clients, future employees or
            the media. Logos and colors are not properly defined and mixed
            versions of the logos are circulating around in workspaces.
            <h4>Solution</h4>I developed brand and visual styleguide to help
            everyone in their daily client work. It includes the correct color
            codes, tone of voice, samples of text and imagery as well as proper
            logo usage. I designed document templates for Word and PowerPoint as
            well as other brand assets, such as an icon and font bank, Adobe CC
            color package, social media hashtags and automated marketing
            campaigns.

            <h4>Background</h4>
            Due to strict confidentiality and the intellectual property laws
            implemented in the contract signed with IBM, I am not allowed to
            present my work to outside parties nor discuss the clients I have
            worked with. A few of the Finnish clients which have publicly
            promoted IBM’s cooperation, such as Finnair and Nokia, are just some
            of the clients for which I worked for as a designer.
            <h4>Focus</h4>All of the work I did at IBM was enterprise-centered,
            focusing on enterprise-level users and employee experience rather
            than customer and commercial. Most design work had to do with Watson
            AI-powered chatbots for IBM’s clients. My tasks varied from leading
            workshops, to user interviews and tests, to collaboratively working
            with data scientists, developers and product owners on a daily

            <h4>Background</h4>
            Helsinki City Transport HKL organized an open call for artworks for
            all the metro stations in the Helsinki branch. Participation was
            anonymous and the submissions would be judged based on the artistic
            value and historical implications as well as timelessness. Together
            with a good friend of mine,{" "}
            <a href="http://misaelrojas.com/">Misael Rojas</a>, we submitted an
            artwork for the University of Helsinki metro station, which is one
            of the three busiest metro stations in Helsinki due to its location
            near the governmental, private enterprise hubs.
            <h4>Outcome</h4>The design takes into account the historical nature
            of the station, being the last one to be completed in Helsinki in
            the late 90s. Neon lights and tile patterns complement the station’s
            spirit. We took nearly 300 images from which we vectorized shapes
            from iconic buildings around the station. It gives the daily user of
            the metro station something new to look for and spot in their
            surroundings during their daily routines.

            <h4>Background</h4>
            In 2018 I worked as a Communications Intern at the City of Helsinki
            Urban Environment Division. During the summer I noticed the largest
            construction site of Central Library Oodi being surrounded by light
            green wooden walls. In front of the Finnish Parliament, it is the
            most central site in Helsinki. I gathered funding and organized to
            get artists from womens’ collective Mimmit Peinttaa to cover these
            walls with art and stories.
            <h4>Outcome</h4>The walls were painted in early September. I made
            and designed the promotional texts and logos in stencil form for the
            city and companies. The works have appeared in many publications
            such as Helsingin Sanomat and several Instagram accounts.
